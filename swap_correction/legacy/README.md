# Legacy Code

This directory contains a snapshot of the original codebase before the refactoring and streamlining process. These files are kept for reference and are not actively maintained or tested.

## Contents

- `__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `kalman_filter.py` - Kalman filter implementation for tracking
- `metrics.py` - Metrics calculations for tracking data
- `pivr_loader.py` - Data loading and settings management
- `plotting.py` - Visualization functions
- `swap_correct.py` - Main entry point and correction pipeline
- `tracking_correction.py` - Core tracking correction logic
- `utils.py` - Utility functions

## Purpose

These files are preserved to:
1. Maintain a reference of the original implementation
2. Allow comparison with new implementations
3. Provide a fallback in case of issues with refactored code
4. Document the evolution of the codebase

## Usage

These files are excluded from testing and should not be imported or used in new code. They are for reference only.

## Version

This is a snapshot of the codebase as of the start of the refactoring process (2024).
